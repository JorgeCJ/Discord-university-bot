A Discord bot responsible for enrolling students and validating their diploma. It was developed with great help from ChatGPT. To get started, enter your Firebase Cloud Firestore information, along with your bot information (like the authentication token) as well as your Discord server ID. If you want to place your bot on Square Cloud, enter the appropriate settings and requirements for your project (one of the required files is squarecloud.app). Detail, to develop the bot, I used the Replit platform.
